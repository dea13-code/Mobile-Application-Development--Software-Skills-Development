###GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF FLOWERSHOP
This is an android application that calculates the cost of a bouquet for different compositions. When the application is getting opened, the client can wait for a bit until it is fully loaded. Later, the client is directed into a view, in which the list of available flowers is presented. The client can choose from roses, tulips, lilies and sunflowers. Each flower type has a different cost, which will be later reflected on the bouquet final price. The client checks the flowers' checkboxes that are desired to be included by clicking them. After finishing the checkboxes, the client can choose to see the final price by clicking the button. This step will forward the client in a different view, where the price is displayed.

####GENERAL USAGE NOTES
-Please note that you need to check whether your environment is compatible before testing the application.
-If you are accessing from a computer environment, it is recommended to test the application in an Android Studio running device version.
-This program does not require installation.
-Please click in the checkboxes of your desired bouquet combination, then press the button to be forwarded to the price calculation. You will not see the price being calculated, only the result appearing on the screen.
